# GitHub publication and upgrades

GitHub is the recommended distribution path. Flare installs from a public
`https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY` URL (optional `.git` suffix). Add
`?path=/plugins/example` to select a plugin directory. Omit the path for the
repository root. Each selected directory contains a complete plugin:

```text
manifest.json
plugin.js             # required for platform or translation declarations
assets/icon.png
locales/en.json       # optional; other BCP-47 catalogs as needed
settings/             # optional offline page and all its dependencies
README.md            # author/user instructions, ignored by the importer
```

The package must contain exactly one `assets/icon.<extension>`: `png`, `jpg`,
`jpeg`, `webp`, `gif`, or `ico`. Its extension must match its encoded contents.
The icon is kept unchanged, limited to 2 MiB and 1024×1024 pixels. SVG is not
supported. PNG remains the default in the templates.

Translation and settings use the unreleased Host API v2 with a matching SDK.
A settings-only package can omit the background script, social platform and
login methods. See [storage, translation and settings](storage-and-settings.md)
for the feature declarations and minimal package.

Development files may coexist in the repository. Flare selects the plugin files;
it does not run a package manager, build script, or client-side bundler. Commit
the already-built classic script when needed and all packaged page dependencies. Several
plugins can share a repository, with separate directories and unique
plugin/platform IDs. Files and resources are relative to the selected plugin
directory; runtime files cannot depend on siblings. For example, repository
snapshot tag `v9.0.0` can contain:

| Plugin directory | Its manifest.version | Installation URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugins/first` | `1.4.0` | `https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY?path=/plugins/first` |
| `plugins/second` | `3.2.0` | `https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY?path=/plugins/second` |

Paths are relative to the repository root and case-sensitive. A leading/trailing
slash is optional; omitting `path` or using `?path=/` selects the root. Use forward
slashes and URL-encode spaces/reserved characters once, such as
`?path=/plugins/My%20Plugin`. Dot segments (`.` or `..`), empty interior segments,
backslashes, and repeated `path` parameters are rejected.

Directory installation and independent plugin versions require a Flare release
with this support; older Hosts only install root plugins with matching tags.
Existing root installations keep using the repository root.

## Prepare and publish

1. Verify the advertised features, using verified endpoints for network features. Replace the
   name, description, and placeholder icon before publication. For manual template
   copies, replace the example plugin/platform IDs; keep the unique IDs generated
   by `npx flare-plugin-sdk@next init my-plugin` stable.
   Keep real tokens, Cookies, passwords, and private fixtures out of Git history.
2. Put the required files in the selected plugin directory and check that a clean
   checkout contains them.
   For the TS starter, run `npm run build` and commit `src/`, the build files,
   `package-lock.json`, and the newly built `plugin.js` in that directory. Keep `plugin.js`
   tracked when background code is declared. Build and commit all settings page
   resources as well; Flare does not bundle them on the device. The generated
   `.gitignore` excludes dependencies and local artifacts.
   Include README instructions for supported website/instances, token acquisition
   if relevant, features, permissions, and tests actually performed.
3. Set each plugin's own SemVer `manifest.version`. Publish a repository snapshot
   tag such as `0.1.0` or `v0.1.0`; the optional prefix is **lowercase** `v`.
   Flare selects the highest stable SemVer tag. The tag selects a repository
   snapshot and does not need to equal any plugin's manifest version. Plugins in
   the same repository can have independent versions. Increment the repository
   tag whenever publishing a new snapshot.
4. Share the repository URL, including `?path=/...` for a subdirectory. A GitHub
   Release page and uploaded `.fpp` asset are
   not required. Creating/pushing the repository or tag follows the user's
   authorization; a generated project alone is not permission to publish it.
5. The user enters the repository URL in Flare plugin management and clicks
   **Install**. Flare selects and downloads the latest stable repository snapshot,
   then shows source and permission review in the same dialog. Only confirmation
   installs the plugin; cancellation discards the download. Errors stay in the
   dialog for retry. Successful installs take effect immediately; verify the installed
   tag/version and running behavior without restarting Flare.

For a first release from a generated project, follow the complete Git setup,
commit/push and tag commands in the [project walkthrough](../assets/github-template/README.md#3-publish-and-install-through-github-recommended).
Stop development for the same plugin before installation or updating it.

Private repositories, arbitrary branch tracking, prerelease tags, automatic
installation, and build-on-device are unsupported. A public repo without a stable
version tag has no installable version, even if its default branch has valid files.

Flare resolves the latest stable tag to a commit SHA, downloads the full repository
ZIP, and imports the selected plugin directory.
Archive checks also inspect ignored development files for unsafe paths/symlinks,
duplicates, multiple roots, and size limits. Downloads above 20 MiB ask for
confirmation, including when their final size is initially unknown. Confirmed
downloads are limited to 200 MiB, 512 MiB declared uncompressed content, and
50,000 ZIP entries. Single-plugin limits remain separate. When the total size is
unknown, the prompt appears after more than 20 MiB has been received. The partial
file is removed; confirming starts a fresh download of the same pinned snapshot.
Source and permission review still follows before installation. Cancellation
removes temporary downloads. Keep node_modules and build caches out of Git. See
[limits](troubleshooting.md#limits).

## Updates and compatibility

Increment the changed plugin's manifest.version and publish a newer repository
snapshot tag. Preserve plugin ID, any previously owned platform ID, repository identity, and directory
for an in-place update. Flare records repository ID, owner/name, directory, tag,
and SHA. A directory move is a source change requiring an explicit new install
review; update checks do not switch directories or fall back to older tags when
the latest snapshot is invalid. A moved tag/source change or new
permission is surfaced in review; prefer a new tag over rewriting a published
one. Failure/cancellation leaves the installed package intact.

Opening management checks for updates using a five-minute metadata cache;
manual checking bypasses it. Discovery compares the selected runtime files using
Git blob hashes without
downloading the repository ZIP. Unchanged plugin files do not offer an update
even when the repository tag/SHA changes. The downloaded canonical package hash
is checked again before review. Manifest, script, icon, locale and settings resource changes all
count; README files and ZIP metadata do not. Download/review/confirmation remain
separate steps. Failed checks are shown as plugin issues. GitHub metadata uses
global proxy routing and
rate-limit handling, not plugin account credentials. Excessive tag lists produce
an error rather than an incomplete “latest version” answer.

For the example above, snapshot `v9.1.0` could update `plugins/first` to `1.5.0`
while leaving `plugins/second` at `3.2.0` with identical runtime files. Only the
first plugin is offered an update. The second keeps its installed tag/SHA until
its own runtime files change. A missing directory or failed check appears as a
plugin issue; retry after fixing the snapshot or connection.

Install, update, and uninstall take effect immediately. Installed plugins are always enabled. There are no general plugin lifecycle or credential migration callbacks. Optional account capability renegotiation runs in the background after upgrades. Media
grants follow the running package; cached media retains plugin ownership and
rechecks that package's permission. Missing plugins cannot restore their media.
Uninstall records removal before account cleanup. Once that record is saved,
account-cleanup or final-index-write failures keep the plugin stopped across
restart; retry deletion from management to finish. Updating or reinstalling
cannot bypass incomplete removal. Unused package-file cleanup can be retried
separately from management after deletion completes.
Publishing controls follow the current account capabilities after capability renegotiation, replacement or
relogin, without requiring the account list to change.

Plugin storage survives updates; the plugin owns schema changes and downgrade
compatibility. Uninstall removes it. Removing the social declaration keeps the
installation's historical platform ownership for account cleanup and prevents
another plugin from claiming that ID. Re-adding that same platform is allowed;
changing an already owned platform ID is not. A plugin that has never owned one
may add its first platform. Settings-only plugins do not need a synthetic platform.

| Change | Author consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Adopt compose/v2 | Old compose/v1 packages remain supported. To adopt v2, declare supportedTypes and handle typed reference; existing accounts retain publish access and restrictions without a new login |
| Adopt v2 header/session features | Set apiVersion to 2; older Hosts reject the package. Existing accounts with unchanged credentialSchemaVersion get Host session metadata atomically without relogin; installation review explains application response-header access |
| Add storage, text translation or offline settings | Use Host API v2 and matching SDK types/resources; feature declarations can be combined or used without a social platform |
| Change plugin data/configuration | Manage the JSON schema and migrations inside the plugin; storage writes update revisions, and declared translation dependencies invalidate cached/in-progress results |
| Remove or restore the social platform | Retain its owned ID for account cleanup; restore that same ID, or add a first ID only if none has ever been owned |
| Update a package with an open settings page | Reopen the page; the old document's Host session is revoked |
| Credential payload format becomes incompatible | Increment credentialSchemaVersion; existing accounts require relogin, with no plugin migration hook |
| Timeline IDs/parameters change incompatibly | Consider timelineSchemaVersion; it changes timeline identities and retires old specs. Explain that existing selections may need reconfiguration |
| Capabilities removed | Running capabilities are filtered by the new manifest |
| Ordinary datasource operations newly declared compared with the account's saved manifest | Current Host admits those new operations without re-negotiating login; do not assume a new login will gate them |
| Add account-http, compose/v3, or new compose modes | Implement [account capability renegotiation](authentication.md#account-capability-renegotiation) to enable them for existing accounts without login; manifest declarations alone do not bypass saved restrictions |
| Previously declared operation was not negotiated for the account | A successful renegotiation can enable it; otherwise it remains unavailable |
| Package hash changes | Account adapter invalidates cached content when refreshing its persisted package snapshot |
| Additive fields, detail types, item/media/action variants, capabilities or operations | Compatible Hosts ignore unsupported extensions; known content keeps its behavior and validation. Unknown detail/navigation types are inert, with no URL fallback |
| Host predates additive compatibility, or an existing contract changes incompatibly | Require a compatible app release; a plugin update cannot retrofit Host behavior. API/schema version checks remain enforced |

Partial search declarations require a Host release that supports them. Earlier
Hosts require all five search operations and reject a partial declaration when
installing or updating from the latest stable tag.

Treat website/credential compatibility deliberately. A version bump alone does
not convert stored credentials. Document new permissions and user-visible changes.
The Host's own cache-database migration is separate from a plugin's versioning;
plugin authors do not control it.

## Optional local installation

Use `.fpp` as an alternative for offline transfer or local testing. From the
generated TS project, run:

```sh
npm run package
```

It checks types, rebuilds the root script, stages only runtime files in a fresh
temporary directory and invokes the SDK packer. The result is `plugin.fpp` at
project root; temporary staging is cleaned up. GitHub remains the recommended
distribution path and this file has no GitHub update tracking.

For other project layouts, create a new, empty `dist` directory. Copy `manifest.json`,
one supported icon, the background script when needed, optional locale catalogs,
and all packaged `settings/` resources into it,
preserving those paths. From the project root:

```sh
npx --package=flare-plugin-sdk@next flare-plugin-pack ./dist ../my-plugin.fpp
```

The complete skill also includes the standard-library-only packer for use without
npm. For example, from this skill directory:

```sh
node pack.mjs /path/to/runtime-directory /tmp/example-feed-0.1.0.fpp
```

The packer ignores only a root README.md; unlike GitHub import it rejects other
development files, including .git, tests, and type
declarations. Keep the output outside the input directory. Packaging success is
not full manifest/registration/behavior validation.

Stop development for this plugin, then in **Settings → Plugins → Add** choose file
installation, select the `.fpp`, review its source/permissions, and confirm. Local
packages are unverified and still require review. Installation takes effect
immediately; test the account and declared features on the target device. No
GitHub source/update tracking is recorded, so later file updates require manually
importing another package.
