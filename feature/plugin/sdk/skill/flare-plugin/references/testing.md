# Validation and acceptance

Record checks against the actual plugin revision. Use the smallest checks that
exercise the edited behavior. Distinguish syntax, mocked behavior, real platform engines,
installation, live website behavior, and platform UI; none proves all the others.
No demonstration backend is required for authoring this SDK.

## Checks in a generated repository

The social-adapter TS starter includes a prebuilt root `plugin.js`. From its root:

```sh
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
node --check plugin.js
node -e 'JSON.parse(require("node:fs").readFileSync("manifest.json", "utf8")); console.log("Manifest JSON parses")'
```

The SDK types help check source code; building emits one self-contained ES2020
IIFE. CI checks that it matches the committed prebuilt script. Type/syntax checks
do not replace Host validation, and parsing JSON does not validate the manifest. Also inspect:

- Required root files and a valid supported icon; stable IDs and version/tag consistency.
- Every declared known operation has its required registration and full method
  set. Social login negotiates supported subsets with a displayable capability.
- Top-level initialization has no Host calls; bundled output has no module or
  runtime platform dependency.
- Each remote response is mapped explicitly. Fixtures cover missing fields,
  invalid JSON, HTTP errors, pagination continuation, and stable identities.
- Auth/cursor/action data is not accidentally inserted into public content or
  media URLs. No real secrets enter checked-in fixtures.
- Compose fixtures distinguish new/reply/quote, preserve opaque target keys,
  reject unsupported modes before upload and keep quote/reply attachment rules
  aligned with the editor. Unchanged compose/v1 packages and saved accounts must keep working; v1 quote
  controls stay hidden and rejected. Verify upgrade initialization is idempotent,
  preserves credentials, and does not revive removed or replaced accounts.
- Temporary page fixtures cover post/quote entry, nested replies, page.parameters,
  opaque cursors and empty-page continuation. Keep entity keys and targets stable
  through detail/mutation results and recover reply context after runtime eviction.
- Media headers reach previews/downloads; test same-origin and cross-origin
  redirects, HLS children, account cache isolation and media permission denial.
  Use dummy short-lived tokens: media headers follow ordinary cache/navigation persistence.

The generated tsconfig loads the SDK's ambient types with strict checking and no
browser/Node globals. Keep manifest/Host validation even when the
type checker passes: TypeScript optional service properties do not express all
capability requirements, and optionality does not make every null value valid.

## Develop locally in Desktop

In Settings > Plugins, open the overflow menu and choose **Plugin development**.
Choose the runtime directory containing the manifest, icon, background script
when declared, and packaged settings resources.
Click **Start development** and review access to your existing accounts. Both Compose Desktop and native macOS support this flow.

For the TS starter, run `npm run dev` and edit `src/plugin.ts` or its local modules.
The watcher rebuilds the root `plugin.js`; syntax/build failures preserve the last
script through atomic replacement. Watch mode does not type-check; use editor
diagnostics or `npm run check` separately. Changes to the built script,
`manifest.json`, `assets/icon.<extension>`, `locales/*.json`, or `settings/` resources are automatically
validated by Flare; click **Reload plugin** to apply the validated
snapshot to this plugin's accounts and open pages. An invalid edit keeps the last
working version running. Keep the starter project root selected. Other build
layouts must select their runtime output directory; Flare does not execute build scripts.

Only one development directory can be active. Reload is refused while publishing,
uploading, deleting, sending or protected storage writes are in progress; retry after the operation finishes.
Reload clears this plugin's derived account caches and restarts its login flows;
drafts, credentials, routes, and other plugins are retained. Changing the plugin ID
requires stopping first. Social declarations may be removed or restored, but an
already owned platform ID cannot be replaced, including after stopping. A plugin
without previous platform ownership may preview its first platform. A credential
schema change may require logging in again. Settings UI is available on native
macOS, iOS and Android; Compose Desktop development does not render that page.

**Stop development** restores the version that was running before development.
Restarting the app loads its installed plugins normally; the last directory is
remembered but never mounted automatically. Development uses real accounts and
data: changes made by the plugin are not rolled back. Stop development before
installing, updating, or uninstalling the same plugin. Recent-call
diagnostics show method names and outcomes only, never request/response payloads.

## Checks with a Flare source checkout

Run from the Flare repository root:

```sh
./gradlew :feature:plugin:jvmTest \
  --tests '*GitHubTemplateTest' \
  --tests '*PixelfedSampleTest' \
  --tests '*PluginGitHubInstallTest' \
  --tests '*PluginTimelineV1Test' \
  --tests '*PluginDetailCapabilityTest'
```

`GitHubTemplateTest` constructs a GitHub-style source archive from the **actual
template files**, passes it through the real importer/registration checks,
activates it after reopening the store, and invokes real QuickJS. It verifies
token/profile identity, link DTOs, refresh/older/empty/end paging, typed HTTP
errors, and malformed website responses using an injected fixture transport.
It does not download a live GitHub repo or contact a website.

`PixelfedSampleTest` packages and exercises the complete Pixelfed sample with
fixtures; `PluginGitHubInstallTest` covers source archive/version/identity rules.
For a new adapter, replace/adapt the fixtures to its actual API evidence and
add checks at this seam. Read the generated test XML/results for executed counts,
failures, and skips; a cached/no-source task is not evidence of new execution.

`PluginTimelineV1Test` covers all timeline item shapes, presentation nesting,
cache serialization, navigation/capability gating, media permission revocation,
polls, reactions and replacement action tokens. `PluginDetailCapabilityTest`
installs the [mixed showcase](../examples/timeline-showcase/README.md), exercises
real runtime mutation results and checks row/entity identity separation. Shared
PostEventHandlerTest, UserHandlerTest and NotificationTimelineTest cover SQLite
hydration, profile updates, and failed optimistic votes. The showcase has no
remote side effects; it can also be used for manual existing-UI acceptance.

For temporary pages, `PluginDetailCapabilityTest` also covers independent capability
negotiation, account/parameter isolation and Zhihu/Tieba-shaped reply contexts with
mock HTTP. Shared `TimelineRemoteMediatorAppendTest` covers flat order and stored
cursor continuation; `TimelinePageRefreshTest` covers invalidation during loading,
hidden pages and an in-flight refresh. These fixtures do not call real child-reply APIs.

For changes to manifests or wire contracts, relevant existing suites include
PluginManifestV1Test and WireV1Test. Runtime/HTTP/login suites cover their own Host
contracts. Run the affected suites rather than requiring a full app build for a
documentation edit. The opt-in Pixelfed live test requires PIXELFED_TEST_HOST and
PIXELFED_TEST_TOKEN; it is read-only unless PIXELFED_TEST_ALLOW_WRITE=1. Do not
enable live writes without the user's current authorization.

## Translation, storage and settings acceptance

For the [v2 interface example](../examples/translation-settings/README.md), install
the complete package on a matching Host, select its translation provider and open
its settings page from plugin management. No social account is required. Check:

- Single and batch documents preserve locked tokens, IDs, entity keys and fields.
- A dependent namespace edit affects new translations and prevents old requests
  from committing; unrelated state and no-op writes retain the cache identity.
- Page writes are visible to background methods and survive reopening/restart.
  Concurrent conditional writes reject stale revisions without losing data.
- Only packaged resources load. Remote requests use SDK HTTP and declared origins;
  blocked navigation, frames and direct network access cannot reach the Host.
- Settings-only packages omit `plugin.js`, and GitHub page-resource edits alone
  are detected as updates. Installed updates and development reloads revoke old pages.
- Exercise iOS, Android and native macOS separately. The demo verifies the contract;
  it does not establish a real translation provider's correctness.

Focused Host regressions include PluginStorageV1Test, PluginTranslationIntegrationTest,
GitHubPluginFingerprintTest, PluginDevelopmentSourceV1Test and TranslatePresenterTest.
PluginSettingsWebViewTest exercises the real Android renderer and bridge. Keep
those checks separate from live translation-service and physical-device evidence.

## Website and UI acceptance

After an adapter has real endpoints and authorized credentials:

1. Enter the GitHub repository URL and click **Install**. Confirm that Flare
   downloads the latest stable tag and shows source/version and permissions in
   the same dialog before confirmation. Check retry and cancellation, then
   install and verify the platform/login/timeline entries without restarting Flare.
2. Verify each supported login method and account identity; exercise cancelled,
   rejected, or expired authentication where practical.
3. Refresh, paginate, open internal/link details, and verify remote media where
   declared. Exercise only the advertised read/write capabilities, using safe
   test accounts/content authorized for those actions.
4. For updates, test a new version without restarting, including credential compatibility
   and removed permissions/capabilities that affect cached content.
5. Record Android, JVM Desktop, iOS, and native macOS evidence separately.
   Simulator/compilation results do not establish physical-device UI behavior.

For temporary pages, enter from both a post and a quote, open a deeper reply,
return to check scroll position, and refresh/paginate through an empty continued
page. Verify reply/like/delete targets, refresh after publishing while the parent
page is hidden, and failure after account removal or plugin replacement. Sort
parameters do not provide a native sort picker; see the [page contract](capabilities.md#api-v2-temporary-timeline-pages).

The generic template's API is illustrative. Passing its fixture tests does not
turn it into a working adapter for an arbitrary website; replace and validate
the API contract before claiming it is ready for end users.

## Skill portability and behavioral checks

Copy `feature/plugin/sdk/skill/flare-plugin` alone into a temporary directory.
Check that its directory name matches the frontmatter `name` and that all relative document/type/template/example references
stay within that copy. Exercise the pack command from the copy if local packaging
is relevant; no parent Flare path should be needed for authoring.

When testing the skill with an agent, use a concrete request with redacted API
fixtures: create a token feed, add article navigation, or diagnose a failed
capability declaration. Check the generated artifacts and behavior, not whether
the answer repeats the skill's wording. Ensure the agent reads only relevant
references, reports missing API evidence, and does not publish without authority.

## Platform engine regressions

The same engine contract suite runs against actual backends. From the Flare repository:

```sh
./gradlew :feature:plugin:jvmTest
./gradlew :feature:plugin:connectedAndroidDeviceTest
./gradlew :feature:plugin:macosArm64Test :feature:plugin:iosSimulatorArm64Test
```

Android needs a connected supported device/emulator and its current WebView provider;
Apple tests need macOS/Xcode and an available iOS simulator. These check string/JSON
and Unicode transport, Host reply correlation, task draining, awaited versus detached
errors, isolation, policy enforcement, and close/cancellation. The existing JVM
package/proxy/account/lifecycle suite still runs against QuickJS. A Desktop fixture
run does not prove Android or Apple behavior; record OS/provider versions and actual
executed counts. Test UI/account/login flows separately on each shipping target.

Do not assert uniform heap/stack quotas or interruption of infinite loops. Test
cancellable Host work and retirement without running an unending loop in the test
process. See [runtime semantics](runtime-http.md#async-completion-and-errors).
