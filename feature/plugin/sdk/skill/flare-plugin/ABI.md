# Flare Plugin API v1/v2

This directory is the authoring contract for Flare Plugin API v1 and v2. Prefer
[GitHub distribution](references/publishing.md); local `.fpp` installation is
also supported. Start with the [authoring guide](README.md) or [agent skill](SKILL.md).
The Host implementation remains authoritative when this document and code disagree.

## Package

An API v1/v2 package is a ZIP with a `.fpp` extension containing these runtime files:

```text
manifest.json
plugin.js             # required when platform, translation or platformExtension is declared
assets/icon.png
locales/<bcp47>.json   # optional
settings/             # optional packaged HTML, JS, CSS, JSON, fonts and raster images
```

The package must contain exactly one `assets/icon.<extension>`: `png`, `jpg`,
`jpeg`, `webp`, `gif`, or `ico`. Its extension must match its encoded contents.
The icon is kept unchanged, limited to 2 MiB and 1024×1024 pixels. SVG is not
supported. PNG remains the default in the templates.

Declare at least one of `platform`, `translation`, `platformExtension` or
`settings`. Use `apiVersion: 2` for translation, platform extensions and
settings. Settings-only packages can omit `plugin.js` and all social/login
declarations. See [Host API requirements](references/manifest.md#host-api-versions).

When present, `plugin.js` is one self-contained classic background script. Static modules, dynamic
imports, remote code, filesystem access, and native access are unavailable.
Settings pages have a separate browser environment and SDK; their packaged ES
modules are supported. See [storage, translation and settings](references/storage-and-settings.md).
Run `node pack.mjs <directory> [output.fpp]` to produce a deterministic package
using only Node's standard library.

## GitHub installation and updates

Flare can install from a public `https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>` URL
(optional `.git` suffix). Use `?path=/plugins/example` for a plugin directory;
omitting it selects the repository root. Every selected directory contains
`manifest.json`, one supported `assets/icon.<extension>`, the background script
when required, and all declared settings resources and optional locale catalogs.
Multiple plugins can share a repository using unique plugin IDs and, when
provided, platform IDs. Resources stay within the
selected directory. Other development files are ignored.

Publish stable SemVer repository snapshot tags such as `1.2.3` or `v1.2.3`.
Flare selects the highest stable tag and pins its commit SHA. Each plugin's
`manifest.version` is independent of that repository tag. Prerelease repository
tags and branch/SHA URL fragments are unsupported. A GitHub Release or `.fpp` asset is
not required; Flare installs committed build output without running build tools.

The Host compares selected runtime-file Git blob hashes before offering updates,
then downloads the snapshot ZIP to temporary storage and imports only the
selected directory into a canonical `.fpp`. It rechecks the package hash before
review. Unchanged plugin files do not offer an update. Downloads exceeding 20 MiB
require confirmation; hard repository limits are 200 MiB compressed, 512 MiB
uncompressed, and 50,000 entries. Existing per-file and single-plugin limits
still apply. Traversal paths, symlinks, duplicate paths, and multiple archive
roots are rejected, including in ignored files.

GitHub installation records repository ID, canonical owner/name, directory,
tag, and commit SHA. Updates retain repository ID, directory, plugin ID, and
any previously owned platform ID. Source/permission review and confirmation remain required. Directory
moves use an explicit new install review. Cancellation or failure preserves the
installed plugin and removes temporary downloads. Changes take effect immediately.

Opening plugin management checks for updates using a five-minute metadata cache;
manual checks bypass it. Checks include all tag pages up to 1,000 tags and report
an error rather than claim a result from an incomplete list. GitHub requests use
the global proxy policy, without account credentials, and respect rate-limit retry
headers. Private repositories,
branch tracking, client-side builds, and automatic installation are unsupported.

## Registration

The background script registers each declared type once, synchronously.
`defineFlareSocialPlugin` registers social detection, login and capabilities.
`defineFlareTranslatePlugin` registers text translation. `defineFlarePlatformExtensionPlugin`
registers [existing-account actions](references/platform-extensions.md).
A combined package calls each applicable entrypoint in any order. Registration
freezes each definition and closes when script initialization finishes.

```js
defineFlareSocialPlugin({
  detector: { async detect(request, context) {} },
  login: {
    oauth: {
      async begin(request, context) {},
      async resume(request, context) {},
    },
  },
  capabilities: {
    timeline: { async page(request, context) {} },
    post: {
      async detail(request, context) {},
      async mutate(request, context) {},
    },
  },
});
```

The manifest is the static upper bound. Every declared known operation must
have the corresponding function, or installation fails. Login returns the
subset supported by that account and instance. An optional
`flare.datasource.account-capabilities/v1` declaration maps `negotiate` to
`capabilities.accountCapabilities.negotiate`; after an upgrade it returns that
complete subset and compose configs using existing credentials, without login.
See [account capability renegotiation](references/authentication.md#account-capability-renegotiation).
Unknown capability IDs and
operation names are silently ignored during installation, login, account
restoration, and updates. Known operations still require their declared methods
and complete required operation sets. A capability containing only unsupported
operations is omitted; an explicitly empty known declaration remains invalid.
Login and snapshot operation lists retain Set semantics, including deduplication
before the limit of 32 distinct operation names is checked.

The following services live under `capabilities` in the social definition.

| Capability | Service operations |
| --- | --- |
| `flare.datasource.account-capabilities/v1` | `accountCapabilities.negotiate` |
| `flare.datasource.account-http/v1` | `accountHttp.authenticate` |
| `flare.datasource.timeline-page/v1` | `timelinePage.load` |
| `flare.datasource.timeline/v1` | `timeline.page` |
| `flare.datasource.search/v1` | `search.posts`, `profiles`, `discoverPosts`, `discoverProfiles`, `discoverHashtags` |
| `flare.datasource.profile/v1` | `profile.byId`, `byHandle`, `timeline`, `following`, `followers` |
| `flare.datasource.post/v1` | `post.detail`, `context`, `delete`, `mutate` |
| `flare.datasource.relation/v1` | `relation.state`, `mutate` |
| `flare.datasource.compose/v1` | `compose.publish` |
| `flare.datasource.compose/v2` | `compose.publish` |
| `flare.datasource.compose/v3` | `composeV3.publish` |
| `flare.datasource.notification/v1` | `notification.page`, `badge` |
| `flare.datasource.list/v1` | `list.page`, `detail`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `timeline`, `members`, `memberships`, `addMember`, `removeMember` |
| `flare.datasource.direct-message/v1` | `directMessage.rooms`, `room`, `messages`, `send`, `delete`, `leave`, `create`, `badge`, `canSend` |
| `flare.datasource.article/v1` | `article.detail`, `comments` |
| `flare.datasource.gallery/v1` | `gallery.detail`, `comments`, `recommendations`, `ugoiraMetadata` (optional) |
| `flare.datasource.tab-catalog/v1` | `tabCatalog.page` |

The [capability matrix](references/capabilities.md) distinguishes required and
optional operations and explains UI dependencies. `PluginAbiV1.kt` defines the
Host contract. Use [flare-plugin.d.ts](flare-plugin.d.ts) for the complete
JavaScript types and [recipes](references/recipes.md) for implementation guidance.

Text translation uses `defineFlareTranslatePlugin({ translateDocumentJson,
translateBatchDocumentJson })`. The Host keeps the internal method paths
`translation.translateDocumentJson` and `translation.translateBatchDocumentJson`; see the [translation contract](references/storage-and-settings.md#text-translation).
Settings-only packages have no background registration to execute.

Compose capability versions are independent of the runtime API version.
`compose/v1` packages and saved accounts remain supported without modification.
The Host sends legacy `replyTo` requests and exposes new posts and replies only;
quote controls are hidden because that contract cannot represent a quote.
For `compose/v2`, declare `supportedTypes` and handle
`reference: { type: "reply" | "quote", key }`. Existing v1 accounts retain their
negotiated publish access and restrictions when the plugin adopts v2, without a
new login. See the [compose recipe](references/recipes.md#compose).

Use `compose/v3` to publish with `friends` or `selfOnly` visibility. The Host
selects `composeV3.publish` when the account negotiates it. A package can include
`compose/v2` with its own explicit legacy visibility config. Older Hosts with
additive compatibility ignore the v3 capability and config and use the declared
v2 config when available. See [compose defaults](references/manifest.md#compose-defaults).

Installed compose/v1 records remain runnable and uninstallable. Legacy config
omission preserves manifest defaults; the Host does not rewrite the package.

Capabilities that map to a full Host interface must declare its required
operation set; installation rejects partial interfaces. Notification filters
(`all`, `mention`, `comment`, `like`) and relation actions (`follow`, `block`,
`mute`) are static arrays on their capability manifest declarations. They are
not asynchronous JavaScript methods because Flare needs them synchronously to
decide which controls to show.

## Invocation and state

Native Apple targets use system JavaScriptCore, Android uses AndroidX JavaScriptEngine,
and Compose Desktop uses QuickJS. Await/return required asynchronous work: the Host
waits for started Host tasks before completing the invocation, but detached Promise
rejections do not automatically fail it. Returned/awaited errors retain normal typed
or fatal handling. Engine availability, version differences, cancellation, and resource
limits are described in [Runtime and HTTP](references/runtime-http.md).

Every method receives immutable request and context values. JavaScript globals
are disposable cache only. Plugins have no lifecycle or migration hooks.

Runtime scopes cover detector attempts, login flows, accounts, guest origins,
plugin translation and authorized extensions. See [invocation context](references/runtime-http.md#invocation-context).
Calls in one Runtime serialize. A fatal JavaScript error, timeout, cancellation,
out-of-memory condition, or invalid Wire result retires that Runtime.

Social operations exchange JSON Wire v1 DTOs. IDs use
`{ "id": "...", "host": "..." }`; page responses use `items`,
`olderCursor`, `newerCursor`, and `endReached`. Timestamps are ISO-8601 strings.
Rich text is `{ "format": "plain|html", "value": "..." }`; Flare sanitizes
HTML before rendering.

`PostV1` requires `key`, `createdAt`, and `content`. Its `author` and `visibility`
fields default to null and accept explicit null. A provided author must satisfy
the complete `ProfileV1` contract. The Host does not synthesize an author or infer
public visibility. These rules also apply to presentation posts and `updatedPost`
results; an updated post is a complete snapshot, so omitted fields do not retain
their previous values.

HTML resource and link URLs must use HTTPS without URL credentials. Relative
URLs resolve against the selected instance. Local files, `content:`, `data:`,
`javascript:`, and other schemes are rejected before rendering.

## Post detail navigation

Each `PostV1` may set `detailType` to `"post"`, `"article"`, `"gallery"`, or `"link"`.
Omitting it defaults to `"post"`.
For example, a timeline may return an article preview with `detailType: "article"`
alongside regular posts and gallery previews. The selected detail receives that
post's `key` and uses the same account or guest origin. Reposted content keeps
its own `detailType`.

For internal details, the target capability must be available for that account
(or declared for guest access), including its required operations: `post.detail`; `article.detail` and
`comments`; or `gallery.detail`, `comments`, and `recommendations`. Otherwise the
post click does nothing; it does not fall back to another detail type. In media
grids, article and gallery previews use the same detail click target.

For `"link"`, the existing `url` field is required and must contain an absolute
HTTPS URL without URL credentials. The Host opens it through the existing browser
flow, following the user's browser settings and bypassing internal detail-link
matching. No post/article/gallery detail capability is required. Post and grid
cover clicks use this target; author and action buttons keep their own behavior.
For example (other required post fields omitted):

```js
{ detailType: "link", url: "https://example.com/article/123" }
```

The URL remains optional for the three internal detail types. An unknown string
`detailType`, such as `"manga"` or `"novel"`, keeps the post preview but disables
post, cover, and grid navigation. Independent author and known action clicks keep
their existing behavior. Omission still defaults to `"post"`; unknown values do
not use that default or fall back to the URL. Null and non-string values remain
invalid, as do missing or invalid URLs for the known `"link"` type.

## Additive compatibility within API v1

Hosts with additive compatibility ignore unknown JSON properties in manifests and
Wire objects. A known object's required fields, types, limits, HTTPS URLs,
identity, and permissions are still validated. Unknown fields never grant a
permission or invoke an operation.

- Unknown timeline item types are omitted from the displayed page; both cursors
  and `endReached` retain their original meaning, even if every item is omitted.
- Unknown media types are omitted from posts, feeds, cards, and galleries.
  Unknown actions and relation action tokens are omitted. Unsupported payloads
  do not need to satisfy the structure of a known variant.
- Unknown navigation target types become inert. They do not trigger the URL or
  actor fallback used when a target is absent.
- Unknown capability IDs and operations do not become available to the account
  or guest. An account still needs at least one supported displayable capability.

The known `flare.datasource.compose/v1` contract uses its own request adapter;
it is not dropped as an unknown extension or sent v2 request fields.

Known malformed data still fails validation. Other enums and control results,
including login transitions, mutation results, and Host errors, remain strict;
an unfamiliar outcome is never reported as a successful write. Resource limits
still apply before unknown entries are discarded. Breaking existing fields,
required methods, or semantics needs a new API/schema contract rather than an
additive extension. Previously released Hosts without this handling must be
upgraded; a newer plugin cannot retrofit compatibility into them.

## API v2 sessions

Declare `apiVersion: 2` for application response headers (including Set-Cookie),
manual redirects, versioned credential updates, and WebCookie pending state and
Cookie metadata. Shared `V1` type names describe both Host API versions. Fields
marked v2 require a v2 manifest. See [Host API requirements](references/manifest.md#host-api-versions).

API v2 exposes headers only from requests the plugin explicitly makes to approved
origins. It does not read browser traffic or maintain a Cookie jar. The plugin
owns Cookie scope/deletion/expiry and any custom header/body token protocol.
Native Apple can fold repeated headers; Set-Cookie is normalized into separate
cookie-pair values, but raw header-line fidelity is unavailable. Native retries
are platform dependent; see [HTTP behavior](references/runtime-http.md#http-request-and-response).

## Migrate an API v1 plugin

1. Validate the current V1 package and an existing account on the target Flare
   build. Use the [timeline item contract](#timeline-contract) for legacy preview
   scripts that return bare posts or old notification envelopes.
2. Preserve `manifest.id` and the social `platform.id` for an in-place upgrade.
   Use `schemaVersion: 1` and set `apiVersion: 2` when adding a V2 feature.
   Apply the feature's registration, manifest and handler changes together.
   For session changes, see the [V2 HTTP recipe](references/recipes.md#api-v2-http-session-state).
3. Keep `credentialSchemaVersion` if the new script can read the saved credential
   JSON. The Host adds V2 session metadata while preserving that payload.
   For a V2 refresh, read with `flare.credential.read({ withRevision: true })`
   and pass the revision as `expectedRevision` to `flare.credential.replace`.
   Increment `credentialSchemaVersion` for an incompatible payload and have the user
   sign in again with the same account identity. See [credential updates](references/runtime-http.md#credentials-crypto-and-locale).
4. Keep `compose/v1` and `replyTo` for legacy publishing. When adopting
   `compose/v2`, declare `supportedTypes` and read `request.reference`. Existing
   accounts keep their negotiated publish access and restrictions. Use
   `account-capabilities/v1` to negotiate newly supported Quote, `compose/v3`
   or `account-http` for saved accounts, or have the user sign in again. Follow the
   [renegotiation contract](references/authentication.md#account-capability-renegotiation).
5. Test the upgrade with the saved account, including the applicable login,
   credential refresh, new operations and timeline or publishing behavior.
   Follow the [upgrade rules](references/publishing.md#updates-and-compatibility)
   for changes to permissions, timeline identity or plugin storage.

## Host API

The frozen `flare` object exposes these methods.

- `flare.http.request` sends JSON, text, form and streaming multipart HTTP.
- `flare.account.http.request` sends authenticated HTTP for [authorized platform actions](references/platform-extensions.md#authorization-and-http) in API v2.
- `flare.storage.open(namespace).read/write` accesses plugin-owned storage in API v2.
- `flare.credential.read/replace` accesses the current account credential.
- `flare.crypto.randomHex/uuid/sha256/md5` provides randomness and hashing.
- `flare.locale.current` returns the current Host locale.
- `flare.error` marks a typed error safe to cross the ABI.

Authentication is structured:

```js
await flare.http.request({
  url: context.origin + "/api/v1/account",
  authorization: { type: "bearer", token },
});
```

Do not set raw `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Host`, or `Content-Length` headers.
Compose bytes never enter JavaScript. Forward the request's asset handle:

```js
await flare.http.request({
  method: "POST",
  url: context.origin + "/api/v1/media",
  body: {
    type: "multipart",
    parts: [{ type: "asset", name: "file", handle: asset.handle }],
  },
});
```

Detector calls may access only the candidate origin. Login calls may also use
exact HTTPS origins listed in `permissions.authOrigins` and `permissions.httpOrigins`.
Account and guest calls may use their selected origin and `permissions.httpOrigins`.
Additional HTTP origins do not grant authorization-page, Cookie-probe, or Deep Link
access. Credentials are sent only when explicitly supplied in the request;
extra destinations do not change account identity or proxy routing.
Automatic redirects stay on the current origin, even when both origins are approved.
API v2 `redirect: "manual"` returns the current hop, including POST 3xx and raw
Location. `response.url` identifies that response and optional `redirectUrl` is
an approved HTTPS target resolved without a fragment. A subsequent explicit
request rechecks permissions, account session, and proxy. Response names are
lowercase and values are arrays. V1 hides sensitive headers; v2 exposes source
application headers while filtering proxy and hop-by-hop fields.

In account scope, API v2 `credential.read({withRevision:true})` returns
`{value, revision}` and `replace(next, {expectedRevision})` returns false on a
local conflict. Unconditional replace remains available. Revisions are opaque;
every successful replacement changes one. A new login or account restore changes
the private session epoch and rejects old calls. When a plugin upgrades to v2 without changing credentialSchemaVersion, the Host
atomically initializes missing session metadata before creating its runtime.
Existing credential JSON and account identity are preserved; no login runs. Never replay a remote refresh or
business write simply because local persistence conflicted or failed.

Automatic media loading is a separate permission, disabled by default. A plugin
that returns avatars, images, audio, video, covers, or HTML images must declare
`"permissions": { "mediaNetwork": true }`. Installation review explicitly grants
media requests to any website, including CDNs and federated servers; these URLs
can transmit the plugin account's data. Adding this permission during an update
requires confirmation. It does not expand `flare.http.request` origins or permit
local-file resources. Text-only plugins do not need it. Cached profiles, posts,
article history, and direct messages retain their plugin ownership and recheck
the running package's grant when restored, including translated and nested media.
Permission removal and uninstall take effect immediately, like the
package change itself; absent plugins cannot restore media.
Development caches predating ownership metadata are rebuilt on upgrade.

`MediaV1.customHeaders` optionally supplies explicit headers to native media
loaders; it does not change HTTP origin permissions or attach credentials
automatically. It shares the existing media cache/navigation persistence and
applies to all URLs in that media item. See [media headers](references/wire-data.md#text-and-media)
for validation, redirect rules and credential lifetime constraints.

Flare owns HTTP routing: detector, guest, and new-login requests follow the
global proxy policy; account requests and relogin requests follow that account's
policy, including OAuth resumed after restart. Plugins cannot select a proxy.
Proxy failures never fall back to direct connections, and changing a route may
cancel its in-flight requests, including uploads.

## Login

For OAuth, Flare owns `flowId`, state, callback validation, persistence,
expiry, replay protection, and relogin identity validation. `begin` returns:

```js
{
  type: "externalBrowser",
  url: authorizationUrl,
  pendingPayload: { /* bounded opaque JSON */ },
}
```

`resume` receives validated callback parameters and returns:

```js
{
  type: "success",
  value: {
    accountId,
    origin: context.origin,
    credential: { accessToken },
    profile,
    capabilities: { "flare.datasource.timeline/v1": ["page"] },
    composeConfig,
  },
}
```

At least one displayable capability must be negotiated. `accountId` must equal
`profile.key.id`, and `profile.key.host` must equal the selected origin's host.
The Host retains this login profile as the current account's identity for account
menus, compose, notifications, discovery/search, and direct-message selection when
a plugin does not provide profile lookup. This fallback never enables arbitrary
profile lookup or profile timelines. Cached login media follows the current grant. Login cannot replace an existing account owned
by another platform with the same account ID and host.

## Errors

Only errors created with `flare.error` are recoverable plugin errors:

```js
throw flare.error({
  code: "RateLimited",
  message: { key: "error.rateLimited", fallback: "Try again later" },
  retryAfterSeconds: 30,
});
```

Codes are `AuthenticationRequired`, `NotFound`, `Validation`, `RateLimited`,
`Network`, `Remote`, `Unsupported`, `InvalidResponse`, and `Cancelled`.
Unmarked exceptions are fatal and retire the Runtime generation.

## Manifest text, icon, and Deep Links

Plugin-authored manifest text may be either a final string or:

```json
{ "key": "timeline.home", "fallback": "Home" }
```

Localized keys must exist in the default locale catalog. Resolution uses exact
BCP-47 tag, language-script, language, default locale, then fallback. The only
formatting feature in v1 is named `{argument}` substitution.

The packaged image is the platform icon on every target and the icon for default
timeline tabs. The first automatically added default tab uses `platform.name`;
other defaults and the manual-add list retain timeline titles. Other manifest
icons use Host semantic enum names. See the
[tab presentation rules](references/manifest.md#default-and-manually-added-tabs).
Deep Links, when needed, are manifest-only structured rules; JavaScript cannot
resolve them.

For full field defaults and validation, read the [manifest reference](references/manifest.md).
All five authentication interactions are covered in [authentication](references/authentication.md).

## Timeline contract

All timeline lists, including notification.page, return PageV1<TimelineItemV1>:
post, feed, user, userList or message. Post detail returns `{ post, presentation? }`;
publish/updatedPost continue to use PostV1. Reposts are in presentation.repost.
Convert old bare posts and notification envelopes to these item shapes before
installing a legacy preview script on a Host that uses this contract.

The Host reuses its current timeline UI and cache, supplies viewer identity and
navigation, and owns pagination gaps. Poll/reaction mutations use post.mutate;
user-card buttons use relation.mutate. See [wire data](references/wire-data.md#timeline-items-and-interactions)
for all fields, limits, permission checks and mutation parameters/results.

API v2 WebCookie `pending` may carry at most 64 KiB `pendingPayload`; the next
check receives it even after runtime eviction. Each pending result replaces the
whole payload; omission/null clears it. The flow lasts at most 15 minutes and
is kept in memory, not restored after app restart. Cookie `attributes` are
optional and duplicate names are preserved; unknown fields remain absent.
After a verified success, local save retries reuse that result until the flow
expires or closes rather than repeating a remote exchange. V1 Cookie checks
keep their original selection and completion behavior.

## Storage, translation and settings

Host API v2 adds independent `translation` and offline `settings` declarations
and plugin-scoped storage. Read [storage, translation and settings](references/storage-and-settings.md)
for namespace revision dependencies, the page SDK and lifecycle.

For actions on existing built-in or plugin-provided accounts, use `defineFlarePlatformExtensionPlugin`.
Read the [platform extension contract](references/platform-extensions.md) for account
grants, authenticated HTTP, scheduling and structured results.

## API v2 temporary timeline pages

`flare.datasource.timeline-page/v1` registers `capabilities.timelinePage.load`.
It accepts `{ pageId, page: PageRequestV1 }` and returns `PageV1<TimelineItemV1>`.
`PostV1.target` and quote posts can select the new `timelinePage` navigation target
with `pageId`, a required `WireTextV1` title and optional string parameters.
The Host binds plugin/package/account identity; target parameters live only in
`page.parameters`. This capability does not register any home tab or catalog.
Existing `detailType` hit handling, paging limits and validation still apply.
See [the complete page contract](references/capabilities.md#api-v2-temporary-timeline-pages).

## Lifecycle and trust

Install, update, and uninstall take effect immediately. Installed plugins are always enabled. Local packages are always unverified. Repository trust is
Host-owned; a manifest cannot claim official status or broader runtime access.

Uninstall removes the plugin's accounts, credentials, account-scoped caches,
selections/tabs, plugin-owned storage, and draft targets from this device, together with local source
and package files. Shared drafts and attachments remain while another account
uses them. Updates preserve accounts and plugin storage; plugins manage their
own storage schemas and migrations. Loading failures or restoring accounts
without their plugin leave accounts unavailable; they do not delete them.
Login, publishing, and uploads can delay or block replacement/removal. Closed
sessions cannot recreate accounts through a late callback. Account ownership and
the persisted removal intent are checked before any account data is changed.
Once removal starts, an account-cleanup or final-index-write failure keeps the
plugin stopped, including after restart, and its management entry remains
available to retry deletion. Updates and installation cannot reactivate a plugin
with incomplete removal. Unused package-file cleanup is repeatable through
plugin management's cleanup action after deletion completes.
